                    <h3>Barangay Santol</h3>
                    <p>Barangay Santol is one of the 38 barangays in the fourth district of Quezon City. It was created way back in 1956.

                        It was a part of a vast tract of land and was allegedly owned by the original residents whose claim to ownership was fortified by Spanish titles. In 1957, Tuazon Estate, administered by the Araneta's as the land owner and started sub-dividing the land and sold it to the present residents. Thru a court case, the Tuazon estate won over the original owners which are being recognized up to the present time.
                        
                        In 1953, a portion of the area was named Barangay Santol and its boundaries were well-defined only in the early sixties.</p>
